# TTS-Class-Timer
Create a timer that will alert the instructor when it is time to take a break, time to break out into lab, time for lunch and time to GO HOME!

Ten minute break every hour,
After three hours of lecture an alert asks if we should break out into lab.
Lunch alert after 4 hours.
End of day alert after 9 hours monday through thursday.
End of day alert after 8 hours on friday with an additional message that says have a good weekend.
